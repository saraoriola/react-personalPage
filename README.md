# My Personal Page with React 🚀

## Project Description

This is a Personal Page project created using React and functional components. The goal of this page is to present information about me, my skills, experience, and the services I offer.

The page consists of several components, each dedicated to a specific section:

- **Home:** Here you will find a personal introduction, providing an overview of who I am and my interests.
- **About:** This section details my professional background, skills, and notable achievements.
- **Services:** This component describes the services I offer and how I can assist clients.
- **Blog:** This space is dedicated to sharing my knowledge, ideas, and experiences through articles and posts.
- **Contact:** This is where visitors can find a contact form to reach out to me for collaborations or inquiries.

Additionally, React Router has been implemented to allow smooth navigation between different sections of the page. The Navbar contains direct links to the following sections:
- 🏠 Home
- 🧑‍💼 About
- 🔧 Services
- 📝 Blog
- 📞 Contact

Contact form data is securely stored in the browser's LocalStorage to ensure user privacy, and upon successful submission, the user is automatically redirected to the main page.
